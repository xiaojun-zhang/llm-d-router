// Runtime confinement of a plugin's endpoint attribute access to the DataKeys
// it declares. Typing AttributeMap by DataKey stops a plugin naming a key it
// never declared in source; the scope here stops it reaching a key declared by
// some other plugin, which is what makes Produces() and Consumes() a contract
// rather than documentation. ValidateAndOrderDataDependencies enforces the same
// contract statically, over the declarations alone.
//
// The scope covers endpoint attributes reached through the extension points
// that receive a []scheduling.Endpoint: filters, scorers, and DataProducers.
// Two paths are deliberately outside it:
//
//   - The per-request store (InferenceRequest.PutAttribute/GetAttribute). It is
//     typed by DataKey but not confined, because in-tree plugins currently
//     exchange request attributes they do not declare.
//   - Datalayer extractors, which write through Endpoint.GetAttributes()
//     directly rather than through a scoped endpoint.
