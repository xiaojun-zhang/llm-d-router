# In-Flight Load Producer Plugin

**Type:** `inflight-load-producer`

Tracks real-time in-flight request and token counts per endpoint by hooking into the request lifecycle. Writes an `InFlightLoad` attribute onto each endpoint in the `Produce` phase, consumed by the following plugins:
- `token-load-scorer`: Scores endpoints based on in-flight tokens.
- `active-request-scorer`: Scores endpoints based on in-flight requests.
- `concurrency-detector`: Provides admission control based on in-flight requests/tokens.
- `prefix-cache-affinity-filter`: Uses in-flight tokens as a load gate to break stickiness.

## Behavior

- **Prefix Cache Discounting**: Automatically detects if an endpoint has a prefix cache hit (via `PrefixCacheMatchInfo`). Only the **uncached** portion of the prompt is added to the in-flight token counter, providing a more accurate estimate of the actual compute load.
- **Token Release Timing**: 
    - If `addEstimatedOutputTokens` is `false` (default): For streaming requests, all tokens are released as soon as the first chunk of the response is received (`StartOfStream`), as the prefill compute is complete. For non-streaming requests (or as a safety net), tokens are released when the response completes (`EndOfStream`).
    - If `addEstimatedOutputTokens` is `true`: The prompt portion is released at `StartOfStream` (for streaming) or `EndOfStream`, and the estimated output portion is released only when the response completes (`EndOfStream`).
- **Request Release**: In-flight request counters are always released when the response completes (`EndOfStream`).

The producer hooks three lifecycle phases:
- **Produce**: Writes current in-flight counts to each endpoint's attributes.
- **PreRequest**: Increments counters when a request is dispatched to an endpoint.
- **ResponseBody**: Decrements counters when a response completes or the request is aborted.

Endpoint departure events (pod removed from the pool) are handled via the `EndpointExtractor` interface to clean up stale counters.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `addEstimatedOutputTokens` | `bool` | No | `false` | If true, adds an estimate of the generated output tokens to the in-flight counter. The estimate is read from the output-length bucket published by the `outlen-bucket` plugin; enable that plugin and order it before this producer so requests are classified. |
| `maxEstimatedOutputTokens` | `int` | No | _(none)_ | Optional upper bound on the estimated output tokens added per request when `addEstimatedOutputTokens` is true. Must be non-negative. Unset means no cap. |
| `prefixMatchInfoProducerName` | `string` | No | _(none)_ | Optional `prefix-cache producer` name to read to find cached prefix discount. Unset defaults to approximate-prefix producer. |

When `addEstimatedOutputTokens` is true, the estimated output per request is a flat
value determined by the output-length bucket published by the `outlen-bucket` plugin:

| Output-Length Bucket | Estimated output tokens |
|------------|------------------------|
| `LONG` (reasoning chains) | 4 096 |
| `SHORT` (tool-call JSON) | 100 |
| `UNKNOWN` (no reliable signal) | 1 000 |

The estimate is then bounded by the client-requested cap (`max_output_tokens` / `max_tokens`)
and `maxEstimatedOutputTokens`. Ranking invariant: SHORT (100) < UNKNOWN (1 000) < LONG (4 096).
When the `outlen-bucket` plugin is not enabled, every request reads as UNKNOWN and the producer
logs a one-time warning.
